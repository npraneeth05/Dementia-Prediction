# 🤖 Dementia Prediction App
```
⬆️ This app predicts the complexity of the dementia disease, which helps in prior medical treatment. This project is a Streamlit-based web application for predicting dementia using deep learning models. Developed as part of a research initiative focused on early detection of dementia, this application enables users to interact with an intuitive interface for real-time, AI-driven predictions. The underlying model is built upon rigorous experimentation and was presented at the AIDE Conference at NITTE, where it received the Best Paper Award.
